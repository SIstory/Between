The leadership of the KPJ, which at the same time took over the leadership of the resistance, decided also at higher levels on a distributed principle because the new occupational borders which divided the state territory – Yugoslavia was divided into 11 different occupational areas – represented a great obstacle for achieving their aims because of different conditions for crossing them and different occupational policies. The organisational policy of the guerrilla warfare was at the same time also in line with its general orientation in the domestic politics, which advocated a Yugoslav state, but one that consisted of more (at least five) nations forming national administrative units, which was contrary to the unitary model of the previous Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1941, the politicians encouraged the creation of national guerrilla commanding units (the so called Main commands of Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Sandžak, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Vojvodina, Macedonia), which could lead the guerrilla units on their territories more easily in times of difficult communication with each other. The KPJ tried to oversee and guide the activities of these guerrilla units.<span id="ftn404_return"><a class="notelink" title="See Pirjevec, Tito in tovariši, pp. 91–98." href="#ftn404"><sup>401</sup></a></span> For this purpose, the leadership formed the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Partisan Detachments<span id="ftn405_return"><a class="notelink" title="The military leadership named itself the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Partisan Detachment in September 1941, the Main Command of t…" href="#ftn405"><sup>402</sup></a></span>, mostly consisting of the most powerful political leaders, members of the highest political bodies with <span class="teiperson" id="person-820"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Josip Broz Tito</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-BrozJosipTito" title="List of persons: No. 820">[pers.]</a></sup></span>, the Secretary-General of the KPJ, as the highest supreme commander.<span id="ftn406_return"><a class="notelink" title="Morača, Jugoslavija 1941, pp. 163–164.

Each of the partisan armies operated in their respective Yugoslav regions under the leadership of regional political bodies and their own commands. The Supreme Command had the supremacy only by name. They all had to operate with their own forces, taking into account current circumstances that were more or less suitable for armed resistance. Soon after the beginning of the resistance in July 1941, great differences in the inner development and power of the resistance movement arose, even though its leaders obeyed the (very) general guidelines and instructions from the highest command of the party and its military command. In the beginning, the partisan army mobilized most quickly in Serbia and Montenegro, where it was joined by a huge number of members as soon as in the summer of 1941.<span id="ftn407_return"><a class="notelink" title="Morača, Jugoslavija 1941, pp. 169–182, 224–228, 447–452." href="#ftn407"><sup>404</sup></a></span> In 1941, the Supreme Command of national liberation units was forced to deal especially with the issues regarding the partisan units in Serbia, where the Supreme Command was located, and could interfere in other resistance territories only occasionally, in writing or through delegates and individual members, but mostly it had to rely on the initiative of the leadership of individual resistance movements which, as members of the KPJ, fully recognized the authority of KPJ leaders, the Politburo of the KPJ and personally equal the Main, i.e. the Supreme Command. The difference between the centralist hierarchy of the Communist Party and the military subordination was not that significant as to cause any problems to the leadership. The guerrilla therefore had support also on the organisational level and in operational methods of the Yugoslav Communist Party. The communists also attracted other political groups and individuals to the resistance, but mostly in an informal way. Only in Slovenia did the Communist Party of Slovenia formalise this cooperation with other political groups in the resistance organisation called the Liberation Front of the Slovenian Nation, in which the communists were the most important and most radical political party, but they did not have the greatest number of members. Other groups joined the resistance organisation with the aim of achieving national liberation, and not so much for the radical social changes.<span id="ftn408_return"><a class="notelink" title="See Eva Mally: Slovenski odpor.

At the end of July 1941, the Slovenian communists included an armed force, which they also originally established in Slovenia, into the Liberation Front as its armed force, which was not the case in other Yugoslav regions.<span id="ftn409_return"><a class="notelink" title="Damijan Guštin: Konceptualni razvoj partizanstva na Slovenskem leta 1941 [Conceptual Development of the Partisan Movement in Slovenia in 1941].

The Slovenian partisan army was also formally included into the common Yugoslav partisan army. Its ordinance defined the inclusion of the Slovenian partisan units as an inclusion of an autonomous and complete organisation under the command of its Supreme Command into the military organisation which was under the command of the Main Command of the Yugoslav National Liberation Partisan Units.<span id="ftn410_return"><a class="notelink" title="DLRS I., doc. 40." href="#ftn410"><sup>407</sup></a></span> Because the Liberation Front was a coalition, such an explicit decision was politically necessary, but at the same time it showed reservations of at least some of the political groups towards the current Yugoslav reality and the emphasized sensitivity of the Slovenian people towards the reinstatement of national sovereignty and especially towards their own military organisation which felt estranged to the Slovenians in the centralist state because it was under a strong Serbian personal and traditional predominance. Such inclusion meant that the Slovenian partisan army started to developed into a direction that was generally determined by the Supreme Command and the commanders attended a meeting of partisan commands in Stolice.<span id="ftn411_return"><a class="notelink" title="Morača, Jugoslavija 1941, pp. 479–489." href="#ftn411"><sup>408</sup></a></span> In winter 1941, following the directions of the Supreme Command, the separation from the <span style="font-style:italic">Yugoslav Army in the homeland</span> took place which was led by colonel and later general <span class="teiperson" id="person-829"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Dragoljub Mihailović</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-MihailovićDragoljubDraža" title="List of persons: No. 829">[pers.]</a></sup></span>. However, the Executive committee of the Liberation Front (the Slovenian National Liberation Committee was no longer active) became the formal supreme commander of the Slovenian partisan army and confirmed military appointments to the highest level.</p><p id="p-186"><span class="numberParagraph">3</span>Such relationship between the two levels of army organisation was in force until mid‑1943, even though the partisan army in Slovenia, which was under the immediate command of the Supreme Command, experienced turbulent organisational and operational evolution. In this relationship, the Slovenian partisan units with their command were a separate and complete part of the Yugoslav partisan army, but they had their own forces and capabilities and were independent in their activities, if we ignore the periodical instructions of the Supreme Command regarding the military organisation and operational plans, which were given more as an advice. The operational leadership of the units was still conducted at lower levels, by the so called command of <span style="font-style:italic">detachment groups</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">operational zones</span>. The communicational abilities of the Supreme Command did not allow them to interfere with the command of the Slovenian partisan units at a strategic level.

After he returned to the headquarters of the leadership in Polhograjsko hribovje (20 km north-west from Ljubljana), he was confronted both by the leadership of KPS and the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front.

From November 1944 to January 1945, the mobilisation of every male resident from Belgrade to south Macedonia was carried out, several new military units were established and the partisan army was renamed into the army of the Democratic and Federal Yugoslavia with three armies. This process ended on 1<sup>st</sup> March 1945 with the renaming of the Yugoslav NOV in PO into Yugoslav Army, which then founded the fourth army in Dalmatia. At the same time, the priorities of the operational activities of the Yugoslav Army changed – its most important tasks were the final operations and the breakthrough at the so called "Syrmian" and "Bosnian" front, which was established by the German army as it retreated to the north-west. The Supreme command considered the strong partisan forces in the hinterland, in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, as an important, but secondary force in the enemy's hinterland, which would be gradually included in the existing units of the Yugoslav Army during the operations for liberation.<span id="ftn427_return"><a class="notelink" title="Anić, Joksimović and Gutić, Narodnooslobodilačka vojska Jugoslavije, pp. 468–481.

The planned starting point was an unified army, in which military serviceman of different nationalities would unite into a unified Yugoslav force according to the formula of "brotherhood and unity". In fact, this organisation was actually partly based on the idea of eliminating national differences in terms of the existing national mortgages, but in particular on the establishment of a military force that could provide external security and internal support for the implementation of an ambitious project of the transformation into a socialist society. With this, they finally rejected the idea that the Yugoslav Army would consists of national armies, which would mean a separate Slovenian part.<span id="ftn428_return"><a class="notelink" title="Vodušek Starič, Prevzem oblasti, pp. 197–208." href="#ftn428"><sup>425</sup></a></span></p><p id="p-196"><span class="numberParagraph">13</span>The Slovenian political leadership saw the situation as it existed by implication, i.e. a model of a special part of the army in the context of the future Yugoslav Army, as the form of military organisation they wanted during peaceful times.

This was also reflected in the formation of its military forces. Patriotism, which was based on nationalism, was an important factor for mobilizing the population for the guerrilla army, which was crucially dependent on the voluntary mobilization and support of the local population. The solutions which the resistance movement tried to implement under the leadership of the Communists were a compromise. They formally maintained some elements of the (Slovenian) national army, but in fact it was the communists who, in the name of discipline as well as their special objective of a revolutionary takeover, led the army into a similar centralist organisational form as it was before the war in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia – which is imminent in the military organisation. However, this model took its final shape only when it was no longer politically decisive, since they seized power and became the political foundation of a new Yugoslav statehood during the final operations against the Nazi Germany in Yugoslavia. The army, which was named Yugoslav Army in the first post-war years, was, as the sum of all influences, an institution which clearly supported the centralistic revolutionary authority, despite the formal federal organisation of the state. The unrealised formal competence of the Slovenian federal state in the military field became something unspoken, but internally present in the internal political developments of the next 36 years of the socialist Slovenia.</p></div></div><!--Notes in [div]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="ftn402"><p><a class="link_return" title="Pojdi nazaj k besedilu" href="#ftn402_return"><sup>399.</sup></a> <span class="noteBody"><span class="bibl"><span id="person-808" class="teiperson"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Pero Morača</span></span><sup><a class="person" href="persons.html#pers-MoračaPero" title="List of persons: No. 808">[pers.]</a></sup></span>: <span style="font-style:italic">Jugoslavija 1941</span>.
